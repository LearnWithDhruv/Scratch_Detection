# Scratch Detection Project

## Overview

This project is designed to detect scratches on images containing text using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow. The model classifies images as either **"good"** (no scratches) or **"bad"** (scratched text). The project involves several components:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling and preparing images for training.
- **Model Training**: Building and training a CNN to detect scratches.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance on test data.
- **Inference**: Detecting scratches on new, unseen images.
